Well, maybe you will never see this document, but I still want to write it.Not only write something for me,but also,save something about me in the world.
What's me? Hm I am just a student who always imagine some great but hopeless things. I have no idea on my future, maybe just be live and try to make my dream come true before I died. But if I have a chance, I prefer to be someone that people will remember them forever, because you know, the most terrible thing is not death, but forgotten. So now I write it in order to let someone could find me in the future, even though it is just some words and sentences.
So how I decided to write it? Well, maybe because I have seen a video about the dead internet users. Once I saw an good fan art about Girl's Frontline,but when I visit his program,he is already killed himself because something. I saw a user said :I have just talk with him a few minutes ago, but now he will never reply me. It let me realized that a person may died soon because of something.And because the bro shared his model before he died, so though he has died for 2 years his model in other fan arts still tell us "He is remembered by us".So that's why I decided to do it, just make something to let someone remember me.
By the way, I suddenly think out a saying "Data is cold, but the spirit in the data is warm." maybe...Well I can not describe it.Anyway, it's 2024 now, Let's wait and see how will I change in the future.
